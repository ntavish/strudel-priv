# Introduction

This paper introduces Strudel, which began as an alternative
implementation of the TidalCycles (or 'Tidal' for short) live coding
system, using the JavaScript programming language. 

The first tentative commit to the Strudel project was on 22nd January
2022 by Alex mcLean, with the core representation implemented over the
following few days. Although this was his first attempt at a
JavaScript-based application, by 27th January, Alex had managed to
uploaded the initial version to the 'npm' javascript package database,
sharing with the wider community for comment. By 4th February, Felix
Roos had discovered Strudel and contributed a 'REPL' user interface to
it, and then contributed a scheduler the next day, so that Strudel
could already make sound. At this point, Alex shared ownership to the
repository with Felix, and the project has since proved to be a
productive confluence of Felix's own work into music representation
and visualisation, with Alex's experience with making Tidal. Aspects
of this work has since fed back into TidalCycles, and both have
continued development while keeping a shared conceptual
underpinning. We plan to continue working towards feature parity
between these systems, although within the syntactical trade-offs of
JavaScript and Haskell, some divergence is inevitable and healthy.

Over the first year of its life, Strudel is now a fully-fledged live
coding environment, porting Tidal's core represention of patterns,
pattern transformations, and mininotation for polymetric sequences,
combined with a wealth of features for synthesising and visualising
those patterns. Strudel can run entirely in the browser, opening
Tidal's algorithmic patterns [@mcleanAlgorithmicPattern2020a] up to
modern audio/visual web technologies.

The main interface for strudel is its REPL[^REPL stands for read, evaluate, print, loop. It is friendly jargon for a live coding editor from computing heritage.], a live code editor dedicated to manipulating Strudel patterns while they play, with built-in visual feedback, which highlights which elements in the patterned (mini-notation) sequences are influencing the event that is currently being played. While Strudel is written in JavaScript, as an end-user code interface the REPL is optimised for simplicity and readability by applying code transformations on the syntax tree level, allowing language operations that would otherwise be impossible. 

Strudel supports several diferent options for directly output sound through the browser, including Tone.js, Web Audio nodes, and CSound. It also supports methods for triggering external software and hardware, including via OSC (Open Sound Control) messages (e.g. for use with Tidal's traditional SuperDirt synthesiser), Web Serial (so far used to work with dancing robot) and Web MIDI (for e.g. controlling synthesiser hardware or a digital audio workstation). 

Strudel split into multiple packages, allowing granular reuse in other
applications. This allows Strudel to be embedded in other web-based
live coding environments such as Gibber and Hydra, opening up these
systems to use with the mini-notation for sequences. Apart from
TidalCycles, Strudel draws inspiration from many prior existing
projects like TidalVortex [@mcleanTidalVortexZero2022], Gibber
[@robertsGibberLiveCoding2012], Estuary
[@ogbornEstuaryBrowserbasedCollaborative2017], Hydra [@jackHydra2022],
Ocarina [@solomonPurescriptocarina2022] and Feedforward
[@mcleanFeedforward2020].

# From Tidal to Strudel and back

As mentioned above, the original Tidal is implemented as a domain specific language (DSL) embedded in the Haskell pure functional programming language, and takes advantage of Haskell's terse syntax and advanced, 'strong' type system. Javascript on the other hand, is a multi-paradigm programming language, with a dynamic type system. Because Tidal leans heavily on many of Haskell's more unique features, it was not always clear that it could meaningfully be ported to a multi-paradigm scripting language. However, this possibility was already demonstrated with an earlier port to Python [TidalVortex; @mcleanTidalVortexZero2022], and we have now successfully implemented Tidal's pure functional representation of patterns in Strudel, including partial application, currying, and the functor, applicative and monadic structures that underlie Tidal's expressive pattern transformations. The result is a terse and highly composable system, where everything is either a pattern, or a function for combining and manipulating patterns, offering a rich creative ground for exploration.

This development process has been far from a one-way port, however. The process of porting Tidal's concepts has also opened up new possibilities, some just from revisiting every design decision, and some from the particular affordances and constraints offered by Javascript. This has lead to new features (and indeed bugfixes) that have found their way back to Tidal where appropriate, and ongoing work that we will return to in the conclusion of this paper.

# Representing Patterns

Patterns are the essence of Tidal. Its patterns are abstract entities that represent flows of time as functions, adapting a technique called pure functional reactive programming. Taking a time span as its input, a Pattern can output a set of events that happen within that time span. It depends on the structure of the Pattern how the events are located in time.
From now on, this process of generating events from a time span will be called **querying**.
Example:

```js
const pattern = sequence(c3, [e3, g3]);
const events = pattern.query(0, 1);
console.log(events.map(e => e.show()))
```

In this example, we create a pattern using the `sequence` function and **query** it for the time span from `0` to `1`.
Those numbers represent units of time called **cycles**. The length of one cycle depends on the tempo, which defaults to one cycle per second.
The resulting events are:

```js
[{ value: 'c3', begin: 0, end: 1/2 },
{ value: 'e3', begin: 1/2, end: 3/4 },
{ value: 'g3', begin: 3/4, end: 1 }]
```

Each event has a value, a begin time and an end time, where time is represented as a fraction. In the above case, the events are placed in sequential order, where c3 takes the first half, and e3 and g3 together take the second half. This temporal placement is the result of the `sequence` function, which divides its arguments equally over one cycle. If an argument is an array, the same rule applies to that part of the cycle. In the example, e3 and g3 are divided equally over the second half of the whole cycle.

The above examples do not represent how Strudel is used in practice. In the REPL, the user only has to type in the pattern itself, the querying will be handled by the scheduler. The scheduler will repeatedly query the pattern for events, which then are then scheduled as sound synthesis or other event triggers.

# Making Patterns

In practice then, the end-user live coder will not deal with constructing patterns directly, but will rather build patterns using Strudel's extensive combinator library to create, combine and transform patterns.

The live coder will rarely use the `sequence` function as seen above, as sequencing is implicit in many functions. For example in the following, the `note` function constructs a pattern of notes, sequencing its arguments in the same manner as the previous example.

```js
note(c3, [e3, g3]);
```

Perhaps more often, they will use the mini-notation for even terser notation of rhythmic sequences: [^Without the semi-colon, this last example is also valid Tidal code, albeit the parenthesis is not required in its Haskell syntax in this case. Tidal does not support passing sequences as lists directly to the `note` function, however.].

```js
note("c3 [e3 g3]");
```

Such sequences are often treated only a starting point for manipulation, where they then undergo pattern transformations such as repetition, symmetry, interference/combination or randomisation, potentially at multiple timescales. Because Strudel patterns are represented as pure functions of time rather than as data structures, very long and complex generative results can be represented and manipulated without having to store the resulting sequences in memory.

# Pattern Example

The following example showcases how patterns can be utilized to create musical complexity from simple parts, using repetition and interference:

```js
note("<0 2 [4 6](3,4,1) 3*2>").scale('D minor')
.off(1/4, scaleTranspose(2))
.off(1/2, scaleTranspose(6))
.legato(.5)
.echo(4, 1/8, .5)
.tone((await piano()).chain(out()))
.pianoroll()
```

The pattern starts with a rhythm of numbers in mini notation, which are interpreted inside the scale of D minor. Without the scale function, the first line can be expressed as:

```js
"<d3 f3 [a3 c3](3, 4, 1) g3*2>"
```

This line could also be expressed without mini notation:

```js
slowcat(d3, f3, [a3, c3].euclid(3, 4, 1), g3.fast(2))
```

Here is a short description of all the functions used:

- `slowcat`: play elements sequentially, where each lasts one cycle
- `brackets`: elements inside brackets are divided equally over the time of their parent
- `euclid(p, s, o)`: place p pulses evenly over s steps, with offset o [@toussaintEuclideanAlgorithmGenerates2005]
- `fast(n)`: speed up by n. `g3.fast(2)` will play g3 two times.
- `off(n, f)`: copy each event, offset it by n cycles and apply function f
- `legato(n)`: multiply duration of event with n
- `echo(t, n, v)`: copy each event t times, with n cycles in between each copy, decreasing velocity by v
- `tone(instrument)`: play back each event with the given Tone.js instrument
- `pianoroll()`: visualize events as midi notes in a pianoroll

Much of the above will be familiar to Tidal users. This example shows some of Strudel's unique support for chords and transposition familiar to students of Western music theory. This differs a little from Tidal's approach and thanks to the integration of the javascript library XXX (? or is this all your work Felix?), Strudel's support for tonal transformations such as voice leading is perhaps respects more advanced than Tidal.

# Ways to make Sound

To generate sound, Strudel supports different outputs:

- Tone.js
- Web Audio API
- WebDirt, a js recreation of Tidal's *Dirt* sample engine
- OSC via osc-js
- MIDI via WebMIDI

Tone.js proved to be limited for the use case of Strudel, where each individual event could potentially have a completely different audio graph.
While the Web Audio API takes a *fire-and-forget* approach, creating a lot of Tone.js instruments and effects causes performance issues quickly. For that reason, we chose to search for alternatives.

Strudel's Web Audio API output creates a new audio graph for each event. It currently supports basic oscillators, sample playback, envelopes, filters and
an experimental support for soundfonts.

WebDirt [@ogbornDktr0WebDirt2022] was created as part of the Estuary Live Coding System [@ogbornEstuaryBrowserbasedCollaborative2017], and proved to be a solid choice for handling samples in Strudel as well.

Using the OSC protocol via Strudel's provided nodejs-based OSC proxy server, it is possible to send network messages to trigger events. This is mainly used to render sound using SuperDirt [@SuperDirt2022], which is the Supercollider-based synthesis framework that Tidal live coders generally use as standard. 

MIDI output can also be used to send MIDI messages to either external instruments or to other programs on the same device. Unlike OSC, Strudel is able to send MIDI directly without requiring additional proxy software, but only from web browsers that support it (at the time of writing, this means Chromium-based browsers).

# Pattern alignment and combination

One core aspect of Strudel, inherited from Tidal, is the flexible way that patterns can be combined, irrespective of their structure. Its declarative approach means a live coder does not have to think about the details of how this is done, only what is to be done.

As a simple example, consider two number patterns `"0 [1 2] 3"`, and `"10 20"`. The first has three contiguous steps of equal lengths, with the second step broken down into two substeps, giving four events in total. There are a very large number of ways in which the structure of these two patterns could be combined, but the default method in both Strudel and Tidal is to line up the cycles of the two patterns, and then take events from the first pattern and match them with those in the second pattern. Therefore, the following two lines are equivalent:

```js
"0 [1 2] 3".add("10 20")
"10 [11 22] 23"
```

Where the events only partially overlap, they are treated as fragments of the event in the first pattern. This is a little difficult to conceptualise, but lets start by comparing the following two patterns:

```js
"0 1 2".add("10 20")
"10 [11 21] 20"
```

They are similar in that the number `1` is split in two, with its two halves added to `10` and `20` respectively. However, the `11` remembers that it is a fragment of that original `1` event, and so is treated as having a duration of a third of a cycle, despite only being active for a sixth of a cycle. Likewise, the `21` is also a fragment of that original `1` event, but a fragment of its second half. Because the start of its event is missing, it wouldn't actually trigger a sound (unless it underwent further pattern transformations/combinations).

In practice, the effect of this default, implicit method for combining two patterns is that the second pattern is added *in* to the first one, and indeed this can be made explicit:

```js
"0 1 2".add.in("10 20")
```

This makes way for other ways to align the pattern, and several are alraedy defined, in particular:

* `in` - as explained above, aligns cycles, and applies values from the pattern on the right *in* to the pattern on the left.
* `out` - as with `in`, but values are applied *out* of the pattern on the left (i.e. in to the one on the right).
* `mix` - structures from both patterns are combined, so that the new events are not fragments but are created at intersections of events from both sides.
* `squeeze` - cycles from the pattern on the right are squeezed into events on the right. So that e.g. `"0 1 2".add.squeeze("10 20")` is equivalent to `"[10 20] [11 21] [12 22]"`.
* `squeezeout` - as with `squeeze`, but cycles from the left are squeezed into events on the right. So, `"0 1 2".add.squeezeout("10 20")` is equivalent to `[10 11 12] [20 21 22]`.
* `trig` is similar to `squeezeout` in that cycles from the right are aligned with events on the left. However those cycles are not 'squeezed', rather they are truncated to fit the event. So `"0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7".add.trig("10 [20 30]")` would be equivalent to `10 11 12 13 20 21 30 31`.
* `trigzero` is similar to `trig`, but the cycle is taken from the start of the pattern, rather than from the current cycle. They would give different results where the rightmost pattern differs from one cycle to the next.

We will save going deeper into the background, design and practicalities of these alignment functions for future publications. For now, they offer a good case study about the different design affordances offered by Haskell to Tidal, and JavaScript to Strudel.

# Comparing Strudel and Haskell in use

Unlike Haskell, JavaScript lacks the ability to define custom infix
operators, or change the meaning of existing ones. So the above
Strudel example of `"0 1 2".add.out("10 20")` is equivalent to the
Tidal expression `"0 1 2" +| "10 20"`, where the vertical bar in the
operator `+|` stands for `out` (where `a |+ b` would be equivalent of
`a.add.in(b)`).

From this we can already see that Tidal tends towards brevity through
mixing infix operators with functions, and Strudel tends towards
spelling out operations which are joined together with the `.`
operator. This then is the design trade-off of Tidal's tersity,
versus Strudel's simplicity.

To demonstrate this, consider the following equivalent Strudel and Tidal patterns:

```
note("0 5 7".every(3, add.squeeze("12 -12))).s("ocarina").crush(4).iter(4)

iter 4 $ every 3 (||+ "10 20") "0 1 3" # s "ocarina" # crush 4
```

The Strudel example uses the `.` method call operator for all
operations and combinations, whereas the Tidal example has `#` for the
default method for combining patterns and uses infix operators for
other methods. The lack of parenthesis in the Tidal example is partly
due to the way that arguments are applied to Haskell's functions, and
partly due to the use of the `$` operator as an alternative way to
establish precedence and control the order of evaluation.

Considering the above, we argue that the Haskell syntax is cleaner,
but that the Strudel syntax is easier to learn. Our informal
observation is that while the dollar `$` operator is very useful in
making code easier to work with, it is one of the most difficult
aspects of Tidal use for beginners to learn. On the other hand, the
deeper levels of parenthesis in Strudel code can be difficult to keep
track of, especially while coding under pressure of live musical
performance. However this difficulty can be partly mitigated through
supporting editor features.

With Strudel, we have little choice but to embrace the affordances and
constraints offered by JavaScript, and while designing a
domain-specific language entirely based on method calls is a
challenge, through creative adoption of functional programming
techniques like partial application, we are so far very happy with the
results. Tidal's functional reactive approach to pattern-making has in
general translated well to JavaScript, and opportunities and
contraints have overall traded off well to create a very approachable
and useable live coding environment.

# The trade-off of flexible typing

We have identified one problem with porting Tidal to JavaScript however, where we have missed Haskell's strict typing and type inference. In both Tidal and Strudel, time is rational, where any point in time is represented as the ratio of two integers. This allows representation of musical ratios such that are impossible to represent accurately using the more common floating point numbers. However while libraries are available that support rational numbers in JavaScript, the lack of strict typing means that it is easy to create a pattern where computationally expensive conversion from floating point to rational numbers are performed late and therefore often enough to overload the CPUs, due to the large number of iterative calculations required to estimate a ratio for a given floating point number.

# Future Outlook

The project is still young, with many features on the horizon. As general guiding principles, Strudel aims to be

1. accessible
2. consistent with Tidal's approach to pattern
3. modular and extensible

For the future, it is planned to integrate alternative sound engines such as Glicol [@lanChaosprintGlicol2022] and Faust [@FaustProgrammingLanguage2022]. To improve compatibility with Tidal, more Tidal functions are planned to be ported, as well as full compatibility with SuperDirt. Besides sound, other ways to render events are being explored, such as graphical, and choreographic output. We are also looking into alternative ways of editing patterns, including multi-user editing for network music, parsing a novel syntax to escape the constraints of javascript, and developing hardware/e-textile interfaces.
