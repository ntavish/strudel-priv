# Stepwise patterning (experimental)

This is a developing area of strudel, and behaviour might change or be renamed in future versions.

Usually in strudel, the only reference point for most pattern transformations is the _cycle_. Now it is possible to also work with _steps_, via a growing range of functions.

For example usually when you `fastcat` two patterns together, the cycles will be squashed into half a cycle each:

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`fastcat("bd hh hh", "bd hh hh cp hh").sound()`} />

With the new stepwise `stepcat` function, the steps of the two patterns will be evenly distributed across the cycle:

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`stepcat("bd hh hh", "bd hh hh cp hh").sound()`} />

Some stepwise functions don't appear to do very much on their own, for example these two examples of the `expand` function sound the same despite being expanded by different amounts:

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`sound("bd hh mt lt").expand(2)`} />

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`sound("bd hh mt lt").expand(4)`} />

The number of steps per cycle is changing, but on its own, that doesn't do anything. You will hear a difference once you use another stepwise function with it though, for example `stepcat`:

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`stepcat(sound("bd hh mt lt").expand(2), sound("cp cp"))`} />

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`stepcat(sound("bd hh mt lt").expand(4), sound("cp cp"))`} />

You should be able to hear that `expand` increases the duration of the steps of the first subpattern, proportionally.

You can also change the speed of a pattern to match a given number of steps per cycle, with the `pace` function:

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`stepcat(sound("bd hh mt lt").expand(2), sound("cp cp")).pace(8)`} />

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`stepcat(sound("bd hh mt lt").expand(4), sound("cp cp")).pace(8)`} />

The first example has ten steps, and the second example has 16 steps, with both played at a rate of 8 steps per cycle.

The argument to `expand` can also be patterned, and will be treated in a stepwise fashion where the resulting patterns from the value in the argument will be `stepcat`ted together:

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`sound("bd hh mt lt").expand("3 2 1 1 2 3")`} />

This results in a pretty dense pattern, because the different expanded versions are squashed (stepwise) into a single cycle. `pace` is again handy here for slowing down the pattern to a particular number of steps per cycle:

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`sound("bd hh mt lt").expand("3 2 1 1 2 3").pace(8)`} />
