# @strudel/node

This is an experiment to run strudel in node.

## Usage

```sh
# Setup
# - make sure node >= 20 is installed
# - make sure pnpm is installed
cd packages/node
pnpm i
# Usage
pnpm start
```

Then run `sclang` with superdirt in another terminal.

You can now edit and save the file `pattern.mjs` to update your pattern!
